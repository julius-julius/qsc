# qsc
A numerical non-perturbative quantum spectral curve solver and database of non-perturbative values of the scaling dimensions of states/operators of various examples of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

If you use the code for your project please consider citing the paper of (Gromov, Hegedus, Julius, Sokolova)[]. Please also consider citing the original numerical solution of the QSC by (Gromov, Levkovich-Maslyuk and Sizov)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06640] , and the first C++ implementation of the QSC numerical method by (Hegedus and Konczer)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02346.pdf] .
