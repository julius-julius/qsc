# qsc
A numerical non-perturbative quantum spectral curve solver and database of non-perturbative values of the scaling dimensions of states/operators of various examples of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

If you use the code for your project please consider citing the paper ... Please also consider citing the original numerical solution of the QSC by (Gromov, Levkovich-Maslyuk and Sizov)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06640.pdf], and the first C++ implementation of the QSC numerical method by (Hegedus and Konczer)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02346.pdf].
