# qsc
A numerical non-perturbative quantum spectral curve solver and database of non-perturbative values of the scaling dimensions of states/operators of various examples of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

If you use the code for your project please consider citing the paper of [Gromov, Hegedus, Julius and Sokolova](). Please also consider citing the original numerical solution of the QSC by [Gromov, Levkovich-Maslyuk and Sizov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06640), and the first C++ implementation of the QSC numerical solution by [Hegedus and Konczer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02346).
