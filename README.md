# qsc
A numerical non-perturbative quantum spectral curve (QSC) solver and database of non-perturbative values of the scaling dimensions of states/operators of various examples of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

If you use the code for your project please consider citing the paper of [Gromov, Hegedus, Julius and Sokolova](). Please also consider citing the original numerical solution of the QSC by [Gromov, Levkovich-Maslyuk and Sizov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06640), and the first C++ implementation of the QSC numerical solution by [Hegedus and Konczer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02346).

## Structute of Repository

This repository has one sub-repository */Local Operators N4 SYM*, which containts the Fast QSC Solver for the spectral problem of local oprators in planar ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM).
